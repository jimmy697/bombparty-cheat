# bombparty-cheat

This was primarily developed by artificial intelligence (OpenAI) along with a lot of self learning by me, ensuring the code works as effective as possible.

## Prerequisites

- Node JS
- npm

## How to use

1. Download all files from this repo and extract them _(preferrably onto your desktop for easy of access)_
2. Go into your cmd or powershell and run the command "npm install clipboardy" **MUST DO TO WORK**
3. cd into the folder in your cmd or powershell
4. Run "node index.mjs"

## Guide for Effective use

- The script is built to give you the longest word based off the inputted sequence of letters, but will not repeat the same word twice unless the program is restarted (to ensure no duplicate words are created)
- Make sure you tab out<->in to make sure the bomb doesn't explode when you're typing!

###### Enjoy!
